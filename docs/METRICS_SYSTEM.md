- Poor detection quality (<50% confidence)
- Network issues (>5% packet loss)
- Resource exhaustion (>90% CPU/Memory)
- Connection failures

## üîí Privacy and Security

All metrics collection follows privacy best practices:
- No personal data stored in metrics
- Local processing only (no cloud inference)
- User consent required for camera access
- Optional metrics sharing with clear disclosure

## üìù Customization

The metrics system is designed to be extensible:

1. **Add Custom Metrics**: Extend the `MetricsCollector` class
2. **Custom Dashboards**: Create specialized monitoring views
3. **Integration**: Connect with external monitoring systems
4. **Alerts**: Configure custom alert thresholds

This comprehensive metrics system provides complete visibility into the WebRTC object detection pipeline, enabling performance optimization, quality assurance, and scalability planning while maintaining privacy compliance.
